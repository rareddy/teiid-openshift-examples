= Virtual Database Deployment [[deployment-cr]]

Deployment of the virtualization is *always* done using the Operator. However, the `Custom Resource` is defined for the deployment of virtualization depends upon the type of development model used.

Once the Operator is available on your OpenShift cluster you can deploy a VDB by executing below and supplying YAML file created

[source,bash]
----
oc create -f dv-customer.yml
----

where `dv-customer.yml` is the CR (custom resource) file that defines your virtualization artifact. 

IMPORTANT:  Before you deploy above virtualization, we need to prepare and gather all the configuration that needed for connecting to the data sources involved. For example checkout the xref:datasources.adoc["datasources"] section.

You can list all the virtualizations available in the OpenShift cluster on a given namespace by executing

[source,bash]
----
oc get vdbs
----

or get a particular one by executing 
[source,bash]
----
oc get vdb dv-customer

# or below to see whole yaml resource for the vdb
oc get vdb dv-customer -o yaml
----

The `status` field in the yaml file defines the status of the virtualization.

If you want to make inline modifications to a virtualization, you can do

----
oc edit vdb dv-customer
----

it will present a editor, once you finish the Operator will do another deployment of the service with new contents.

One can delete the above virtualization by executing

[source,bash]
----
oc delete vdb dv-customer
----

=== Created Service and Routes
When the virtualization completed with its deployment, it will create a Service with name of the custom resource (`dv-customer` from above example), 
- Port `31000` is available for JDBC connection. 
- Port `5432` will be open for any `PG` specific client including a ODBC client
- A `http` endpoint with route will be available for a `odata`. 
- check out documention on the `exposes` tag in the Custom Resource on how to create LoadBalancer or NodePort using which one can access the virtual database from external client application outside the OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.

== Accessing the deployed Virtualization 
Once virtualization is deployed in the OpenShift, it can be accessed using JDBC/ODBC and with variety of PostgreSQL clients along with OData.  See instructions xref:jdbc.adoc[here]
